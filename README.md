## About Me 

I’m Nicola Greco, an Italian bioinformatician currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity at Utrecht University, where I’m entering my second year. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s in Bioinformatics from Sapienza University, driven by my deep interest in biology and passion for understanding evolution and its mechanisms.
