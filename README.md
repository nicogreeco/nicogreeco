## Deep Learning & Applied ML Projects  
Here are some selected projects where I experimented with deep learning and modern ML techniques:

- [JurassiClass: Dinosaur Image Classification with CNNs](https://github.com/nicogreeco/JurassiClass) – End-to-end computer vision project including dataset creation, CLIP-based filtering, transfer learning, and nested cross-validation
- [Deep Learning: CNN for MEG Data Decoding](https://github.com/nicogreeco/deep_learning_project)  
- [RAG-based Helper for Thesis Writing](https://github.com/nicogreeco/RAG_llm) – Retrieval-Augmented Generation system built to support academic writing  
- [Sbobbinator: AI-based High-Quality Lesson Transcription & Revision Tool](https://github.com/nicogreeco/sbobbinator)  
- [Daily Notes: Automatic Daily Work Tracking for Obsidian](https://github.com/nicogreeco/daily_notes)

## University & Computational Biology Projects  
Projects developed during my academic training in bioinformatics and computational science:
