## Deep Learning & Applied ML Projects  
Here are some selected projects where I experimented with deep learning and modern ML techniques:

- [JurassiClass: Dinosaur Image Classification with CNNs](https://github.com/nicogreeco/JurassicClass) – End-to-end computer vision project including dataset creation, CLIP-based filtering, transfer learning, and nested cross-validation
- [Sbobbinator: AI-based High-Quality Lesson Transcription & Revision Tool](https://github.com/nicogreeco/sbobbinator) – Audio-to-text pipeline that combines Whisper/AssemblyAI with LLM-based rewriting to generate clean, structured, textbook-quality notes from lectures, podcasts, or interviews.
- [Daily Notes: Automatic Daily Work Tracking for Obsidian](https://github.com/nicogreeco/daily_notes) – Voice-driven productivity system that converts audio logs into structured Obsidian notes, extracts prioritized todos, organizes work by project, and generates weekly summaries.
- [Deep Learning: CNN for MEG Data Decoding](https://github.com/nicogreeco/deep_learning_project) – Convolutional neural network for decoding cognitive states from MEG signals, applying deep learning techniques to high-dimensional neuroimaging data.
- [RAG-based Helper for Thesis Writing](https://github.com/nicogreeco/RAG_llm) – Retrieval-Augmented Generation system built to support academic writing  


## University & Computational Biology Projects  
Projects developed during my academic training in bioinformatics and computational science:

- [Network Science: Clustering of PPI Networks](https://github.com/nicogreeco/network_science_project) - Analysis and clustering of protein–protein interaction networks using network science methods to uncover functional modules in biological systems.
